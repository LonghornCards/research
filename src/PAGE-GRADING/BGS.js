            For over 40 years, Beckett has been a well-known name in the sports card industry, with its grading service, BGS, being established in 1999. They are especially renowned for grading newer cards. BVG as it is called, was introduced in 2001 and is the only grading service committed exclusively to vintage cards. A new addition to the line is the Beckett Grading Services Club, a new value-packed grading club that provides collectors value. The new BGS Club offers four levels of membership allowing an opportunity for every budget. BGS uses a unique grading scale that includes half-point grades, offering a more nuanced assessment of a card's condition. Their graded cards are encapsulated in tamper-evident cases. Beckett is particularly known for its thorough assessment of a card's corners, edges, surface, and centering.

            BGS grading is a process of assessing the condition of a trading card and assigning it a numerical grade based on a set of predefined criteria. There are four subgrades that are commonly used: centering, corners, edges, and surface. A card with high subgrades in all four categories will receive a high grade based on a 10-point scale, while a card with low subgrades will receive a lower numerical grade. Their scale is 1 (Poor), 2 (Good), 3 (Very Good), 4 (Very Good), 5 (Excellent), 6 (Excellent Mint), 7 (Near Mint), 8 (Near Mint), 9 (Mint), 9.5 (Gem Mint), 10 (Pristine), and 10 (Pristine 10's). Beckett reviews both the front and back of all cards in these four categories.

            Centering refers to the alignment of the card within its borders. A card with perfect centering has even borders on all sides. If a card is off-center, it can affect the overall appearance of the card and lower its grade. The corners of a trading card are one of the most critical factors in determining the card's grade. The card should be free of dings, creases, bends, or discoloration. Cards with these flaws will receive a lower grade. The edges of a trading card are another factor that is considered in grading. The edges should be crisp and free of any fraying, chipping, and dings. Cards with rough or damaged edges will receive a lower grade. Finally, the surface of the trading card refers to the front and back of the card. The surface should be free of stains, smudges, and scratches. Any surface damage, including manufacturer print defects or ink smears, will result in a lower grade.

            To be graded a BGS 10 Pristine, the centering must be 50/50 all around on front and 55/45 or better on back; the corners and edges must be perfect to the naked eye and virtually flawless under intense scrutiny; and there must be no print spots on the surface. Flawless color, devoid of registration or focus imperfections. Devoid of scratches and metallic print lines.

            BGS encapsulation is a classy design called their BGS Case Diagram, with metallic labels based on the grade. The label is Black for Perfect Pristine 10's, Gold for Pristine 10 and Gem Mint 9.5, and Silver for all other grades. The cases are safe and secure, and ultrasonically welded to be tamper-proof and water-resistant. Easy Identification of the overall numerical grade + 4 category subgrades appear on the front of the label, along with the card description for full transparency of the graded card. BGS also includes a sealed, archival inner sleeve to protect the card from internal movement that will not detract from card clarity.
