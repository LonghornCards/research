            World Class Grading (WCG) has a team of qualified and knowledgeable professionals that have been grading cards for over 25 years. They are split into new and vintage divisions. Their graders understand that all cards were not produced in the same manner, and grading must take into consideration special circumstances that may surround a specific card. They are trained in knowing papers, inks, photography, and printing techniques, as well as knowing how to measure centering, check corners, and look for surface wear.

            They also offer all the complete information on their labels. WCG uses an easy-to-understand 1 to 10-point grading scale, with descending increments of one-half point (for example 10, 9.5, 9, 8.5, etc.). WCG claims to provide the fastest turnaround time in the industry, with an easy submission process. The optical-grade holders for the graded cards provide enhanced UV protection and are sealed to be airtight and watertight.
