            MNT Grading is based in Canada and positions itself as a modern entrant to the card grading industry. They provide high-quality slabs manufactured in North America and employ a team of professionals with extensive knowledge about the trading card industry. Their slabs are sonically sealed and tamper-proof, and they use the industry-standard 1-10-point grading scale with half-point increments.
        </p>
        <p>
            MNT grades cards on 5 potential weighted categories: centering, corners, edges, surface, and inner window (if applicable). A "Flawless 10" card is perfect in all categories of grading (Centering, Surface, Corners, Edges, and Inner Window [if applicable]). A Flawless 10, with all sub-categories graded 10, will be marked on a special cracked ice black label. A Pristine 10 will be marked on a special cracked ice label. A graded Mint 9 to GEM Mint 9.5 will be marked with a gold label. Any graded cards receiving near-mint+ 8.5 or lower will be marked on a silver label.
