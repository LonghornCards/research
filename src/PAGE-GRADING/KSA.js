            Since 1996, Canadian-owned KSA Certification has been providing card grading services and other types of services for the collectibles industry. KSA uses a 10-point certification process that includes checking centering, corners, cut, color, borders, enamel, focus, picture quality, registration, and micro imperfections. Cards are measured, checked under magnification, and special lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
            KSA sonically seals all its graded cards in a scratch-resistant, optical quality, UV-protected holder. All cards graded by KSA have a unique serial number that corresponds to the card information and grade. This number is stored in their database for future reference and authenticity verification.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their grading process is designed to ensure that all cards meet high standards of quality and preservation, making them a reliable choice for collectors who wish to protect and authenticate their valuable collectibles. KSA's holders are designed to offer superior protection and clarity, ensuring that graded cards retain their condition and value over time.
