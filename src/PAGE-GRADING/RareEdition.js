            Rare Edition combines technology with human graders to scale their grading process and adapt to changes in the card grading industry. Their holders provide modern protections including hidden security, holo stamps, NFC chips, and a QR code to explore more information and verify. Their proprietary Computer Vision (CV) system uses a multi-step certification process to scan the cards for authenticity and grade according to their methodology. Their team researches every item to make sure each card's information is correct, along with finding out what makes it special. Every Rare Edition card has been reviewed by their team.

            Each card graded at their facility receives a comprehensive overall grade derived from data, formulas, and specific rules. The overall grade of a card is not merely an average of its sub-grades. Instead, it's determined by a blend of rules and formulas, where the objective aspects of condition and visual appeal converge with the subjective art of grading. Their grading technology, along with human graders, reviews every card and works together to assign consistent and accurate grades. The graders review high-resolution imaging of each card while holding the card in front of them. The scans and CV results are compared against the card itself, after which graders categorize and update any condition deviations in the system. This approach leads to the detailed grading report, where you can see exactly why your card got the grade it did.

            Everything is shown in the card's grading report. Every card is then encased after grading, and security features are added. The label is printed, and it is encased within a crystal-clear polycarbonate with Corning Gorilla Glass. The high-frequency vibrations of their ultrasonic welder melt both pieces of polycarbonate together, creating a bond without the need for glue or adhesive. Once the pieces have been welded together, Corning Gorilla Glass is placed on the front and the back to provide superior scratch resistance and a premium feel.

            A unique aspect of Rare Edition is their Rare Moments feature that combines NFC technology in the Rare Edition Graded holder with content creation and video attachments to create a one-of-a-kind collectible. With the Rare Edition graded card, you can attach your own videos creating a unique collecting experience. Parents can gift graded cards to their children with personal videos attached, along with other experiences from third-party content creation services.
