            Established at the National Sports Collectors Convention in 2002, Pristine Grading International (PGI) has been serving the collecting community for over twenty years. Located in Las Vegas, PGI carves a niche by addressing grading needs in the lower-priced card market. They provide an economic model that allows it to be cost-effective to grade lower-priced cards in your collection that could one day become more valuable. PGI grades all cards with a fair market value of less than $100 in ungraded condition and was produced after 1980. By specializing in this market sector, they can maintain an understanding of the cards, delivering quality service and maintaining a viable price point for grading and resale.

            Fair market value is defined as an average of completed online auctions and fixed price sales, based on current market data. PGI grades based on the industry standard 1-10-point scale, with Pristine 10 being the highest grade. A Pristine 10 is a flawless card with 50/50 centering and perfectly sharp at all corners, clean edges, no lack of gloss, and no imperfections or printing anomalies. Less than 1/10th of 1% of PGI cards have obtained this standard to date. A gold label is issued instead of the standard PGI sage green label. Due to the nature of the cards graded, PGI does not recommend encapsulating cards graded lower than Near Mint 8.
