                Card grading is a meticulous process conducted by professional grading companies or organizations specializing in the evaluation of collectible cards. The exact details of the grading process can vary slightly between grading companies. Grading has become an essential aspect of the collectibles market, providing authenticity and value to cards. According to Edge Grading, in the first half of 2023 alone PSA graded over 6.4 million cards out of an industry total of roughly 8 million. Plus, SGC showed to be growing in popularity and has increased to 7% market share. Their survey showed an overwhelming majority of respondents choosing PSA.

                The cost of card grading varies between companies and is typically based on a number of factors including desired turnaround time and estimated card value. The base grading fee ranges from around $10 to $39 per card for standard service. However, for high-value cards or expedited services, the fee can be significantly higher. Some grading companies adjust their fees based on the estimated value of the card. For example, if you submit a card that is expected to be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars, you might pay a higher grading fee as a percentage of the card's value. Faster services, such as "express" or "super express," usually cost more than standard or economy services. Prices for expedited services can range from $50 to several hundred dollars or more per card.

                Starting in 1984 when Accugrade Sportscard Authentication (ASA) introduced the process of grading sports cards centering has been a key factor in the final grade of every card authenticated and slabbed ever since. Centering specifications vary between grading companies. Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) is the most lenient - 60/40 centering on the front and 75/25 on the back are the general guidelines for what could be considered a Gem Mint 10. Beckett Grading Services (BGS) is the strictest - requiring 50/50 on both the front and back to be eligible for a grade of 10.

                Having trading cards graded by a reputable grading company can potentially add value to the cards, but it depends on several factors, including the card's rarity, condition, and the grading company's reputation. There are many examples of Gem Mint-graded cards that have sold for over 10x the value of an identical ungraded (raw) card. During the pandemic, there was a massive increase of new collectors and grading baseball cards exploded. There are currently over 25 card grading companies in the United States alone. The 10 widely regarded as the most trusted based on grading accuracy are Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), Beckett Grading Services (BGS), Sportscard Guaranty Corporation (SGC), Certified Sports Guaranty (CSG), International Sports Authentication (ISA), Hybrid Grading Approach (HGA), Technical Authentication & Grading (TAG), Arena Club, Rare Edition, and Edge Grading. However, the top 4 grading companies by far dominate the market, currently.
