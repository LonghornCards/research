            The DCI team consists of graders who take each card through a series of tests to verify each card's edges, surface, centering, measurements, and more. They use high-powered magnification, color-accurate lighting, and industry-standard measuring tools. DCI uses the industry-standard 1-10-point grading scale, with DCI 10 being the highest grade. DCI 10 is characterized by 4 sharp corners, original card gloss on the surface of the card without dimples, scratches, or indentations. The example should have sharp edges and corners. Centering on the card should be at least 55/45.
