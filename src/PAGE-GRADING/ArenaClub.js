            Arena Club was founded in 2021 and is a well-funded entrant to the sports card industry. With Derek Jeter as a founding member, the company packs star power to build credibility and awareness for their different approach. Powered by advanced machine learning, they claim their grading process is accurate, fast, and transparent. With a full grade rationale provided and explanation of how the card was scored. They convert the physical cards to digital and store the cards via an online display in your personal showroom. The digitization allows for more efficient buying, selling, and trading, and it avoids the hassles with shipping cards. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for added security and transparency.

            For Arena Club, you submit your cards (raw or graded) to be graded, vaulted, and minted. The minting process creates a new token (NFT) on a blockchain for the card to be digitized and seamlessly transacted. Retrievals of the card have a small fee. They claim to have the lowest grading fees and commission fees in the industry, and fees can further be reduced by integrating all aspects of the buying, grading, selling, and trading. The digital showroom assigned to each user acts as a social forum in which to attract followers and highlight your collection -- with celebrities like Derek Jeter and Steve Nash currently showcasing their collections.

            Each card graded by Arena Club has an "Arena Code" unique ID that is displayed on the front label. Graded cards include subgrades for centering, corners, edges, and surface. The slabs for the cards are superior quality and custom made with an inner sleeve and specialty sized card cavity for security. The QR code on the back directs to more detailed information about the card and grading report.

            The graders, aided by computer vision and artificial intelligence, examine every detail of every card. Cards are given four sub-grades (a fifth auto grade is given to signatures), adding up to a more accurate and comprehensive overall grade. After that first round of grading, it's reviewed by another grader. Then a third round of review, before it is prepped for slabbing.

            Their ultrasonic welding machine creates an air-tight encapsulation, so the card is safe and secure in a custom slab. The slab is bagged in a sleeve, and vaulted cards are then secured and stored in their 24/7 secure surveillance facility with temperature and moisture control. Every card is fully insured and protected.
