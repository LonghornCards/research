            SGC has been in the grading business since 1998 and has built a reputation for its focus on older, vintage cards. SGC is known for its straightforward grading scale and fast turnaround times. They provide a tuxedo-like black matting within their encapsulation, which enhances the card's visual appeal. Their focus on vintage cards makes them a go-to for collectors of historic baseball memorabilia.

            Similar to other grading companies, SGC uses a 1-to-10-point scale for grading cards, with half-point grades in addition to round numbers. The grades are 1 (Poor), 2 (Good), 2.5 (Good+), 3 (Very Good), 3.5 (Very Good+), 4 (Very Good/Excellent), 4.5 (Very Good/Excellent+), 5 (Excellent), 5.5 (Excellent+), 6 (Excellent/Near Mint), 6.5 (Excellent/Near Mint+), 7 (Near Mint), 7.5 (Near Mint+), 8 (Near Mint/Mint), 8.5 (Near Mint/Mint+), 9 (Mint), 9.5 (Mint+), 10 (Gem), and 10 (Pristine). An SGC 10 Pristine card is a "virtually flawless" card. 50/50 centering, crisp focus, four sharp corners, free of stains, no breaks in surface gloss, no print or refractor lines, and no visible wear under magnification.
