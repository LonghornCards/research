            Revolution Card Grading (RCG) is based in Massachusetts and provides a 1-10-point grading scale based on their team's methodology. They derive a total score and then divide that by 4. Centering is based on the lowest grade from left to right and top to bottom. The total final grade cannot be more than 1 grade higher than the lowest grade. It takes all 4 subgrades being given 10 to receive a perfect "Crown Jewel 10", which means there are virtually no imperfections with the card. The centering is 50/50 to 52/48, or better, on the front and 60/40, or better, on the back of the card. The corners should be perfect, crisp, and sharp. The edges should be perfect and nearly free of flaws under magnification. Finally, the surface should have no printing imperfections or print spots. The coloring should be vivid and perfect, with a high gloss and no scratches or print lines. The focus of the image needs to be perfect. The two ways to score a 10 are a quad 10 Crown Jewel and a Jewel 10, which is 3 10's and a 9.5.

            A unique aspect of RCG is the ability to customize your slab with your own unique design. They have patent-pending, direct-to-slab printing technology that is tamper-proof and provides an attractive display. They do not use paper labels and print instead on the inside of the slab itself - there will be no slipping of the label, no fading, and no way to reproduce or transfer the label. This will also help prevent fraud. In addition, RCG is currently the only company to not only print directly onto the graded slabs but also to offer short-run and low population refractor, prism, and gold label inserts. If a card receives a perfect quad 10 grade, it achieves the 22kt gold label status, which is encapsulated in their Royal gold slab.
