            Their GEM-MT 10 card grade is characterized by 60/40 or better centering, sharp focus, sharp corners, free of stains, no breaks in surface gloss, and little visible wear. A slight printing imperfection or surface scratch is allowable if it does not detract from the aesthetics of the card. The overall look of the card is calculated in the grade.
