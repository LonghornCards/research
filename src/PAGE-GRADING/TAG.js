            Technical Authentication & Grading (TAG) is a technology-backed card grading solution that owns several patents and has been in existence for around 10 years. A convenience submission kit can be provided that contains all the supplies you need to protect and submit the cards for grading. Every TAG graded card includes a detailed Digital Imaging & Grading Report (DIG). By scanning the TAG Grade on the slab with a smartphone, you can instantly access high-res images of all the identified defects, scoring breakdowns for individual card attributes, Population, Leaderboard, Chronology, and more.

            Their patented grading system scores on a 1000-point scale & translates into an industry standard 1-10 Grade. Their highest grade is 10 Pristine and utilize half-points in addition to rounded grades. The 10 Pristine grade is characterized by 1) the front image being centered within a tolerance of ~51/49 and back image within ~54.5/45.5; 2) a card will display virtually flawless corners. No visible wear or fraying. Under high resolution imagery, the corners appear sharp and crisp with little to no fill or fray artifacts; 3) a flawless surface, exhibiting only Non-Human Observable Defects (NHOD's); and 4) a card will display virtually flawless edges. Under high resolution imagery, the edges have very minor fill or fray artifacts. Using Photometric Stereoscopic Imaging, TAG claims to offer a high level of grading accuracy.
