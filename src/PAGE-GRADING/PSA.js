            Founded in 1991, PSA has become one of the largest and most respected card grading services in the world. It is known for its detailed grading scale ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 being a virtually perfect card. Cards that exhibit high-end qualities with each grade, between PSA 2 and PSA 9, may achieve a half-point increase. The PSA grades are 1 (Poor), 1.5 (Fair Grade), 2 (Good), 3 (Very Good), PSA 4 (Very Good-Excellent), PSA 5 (Excellent), PSA 6 (Excellent-Mint), PSA 7 (Near Mint), PSA 8 (Near Mint-Mint), PSA 9 (Mint), and PSA 10 (Gem-Mint). PSA's encapsulation process preserves the card's condition while ensuring its authenticity.

            Their grading system is widely recognized and trusted, often leading to a higher resale value for cards graded by PSA. According to PSA, their research shows that PSA graded cards sell for more than competitors 9 out of 10 times. They also offer a comprehensive database of graded cards, providing valuable information for collectors.

            PSA will only grade after a trading card has been deemed authentic. Authentication is the process of verifying the originality or genuineness of a trading card. Grading is assessing the quality and condition of a trading card. PSA assigns a grade based on a variety of different qualifiers including marks on the card ("MK"), the cut of the card ("MC"), centering ("OC"), staining ("ST"), print defects ("PD"), and whether the card is out of focus ("OF"). PSA will not grade cards with evidence of trimming, re-coloring, restoration, or any other forms of tampering, or are of questionable authenticity.

            While a large part of PSA's grading process is objective, there is a component of their grading process that is somewhat subjective. PSA graders reserve the right, based on the strength or weakness of the eye appeal, to make a judgment call on the grade of a particular card. There are times when a PSA grader must make a call on a card that falls on the line between two grades and that final determination is made based on experience, eye appeal and market acceptability. To be considered a PSA 10 GEM-MT grade, which is a virtually perfect card, the card must have 4 sharp corners, sharp focus, and full original gloss. There must not be any staining but there is a small allowance for minor print imperfections. The image must be centered on the card within a tolerance not to exceed approximately 55/45 to 60/40 on the front, and 75/25 percent on the reverse.

            PSA encapsulates every trading card in a tamper-evident, sonically sealed case. These attractive, durable plastic cases provide protection from pressure and most damage. Their branded PSA LightHouse Label provides the full information for the card including the grade and card details. In 2017, PSA enhanced the security features found on the label used inside the PSA holder. Not only does this label exhibit new security properties, it also underwent a stylistic, branding makeover.
