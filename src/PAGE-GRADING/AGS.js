            Automated Grading Systems (AGS) was launched in 2021 and provides an approach that uses 100% Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to grade cards. They are based in New York. Their RoboGrading technology guarantees an unbiased, consistent, and fast grading process. To the robot, the card is just a variation of pixels, and it learns from expert graders and applies it. Without human subjectivity, AGS claims to provide a more reliable and consistent approach. AGS provides 8 subgrades per card, plus free HD photos and AI scans for every grade. They provide details for the grade rationale along with scans and scores for corners, edges, centering, and surfaces.

            Their technology looks for scratches, print lines, surface composition, and other microscopic details that can easily be missed by the human eye. They also offer an app to pre-grade cards using their proprietary technology so you can get an idea of whether itâ€™s cost effective to grade certain cards based on the projected grade and value. Interestingly, Master P is an investor and on their Board of Directors. They note significant investments in their technology and seek to differentiate themselves with cutting edge grading technology.
