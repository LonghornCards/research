            Since 2010, International Sports Authentication (ISA) has been in the sports cards industry as well. In 2020 they were ranked amongst the top grading companies, and in 2021 they revamped their label, security, and website features. Grading involves individual judgments that are subjective and require the exercise of professional opinion, which can change from time to time. They have the standard 1-to-10-point grading scale and assign half-point grades to high-end cards within a particular grade from ISA 1 to ISA 8 -- the primary focus is eye appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The grading scale is 1 (Poor), 2 (Good), 3 (Very Good), 4 (Very Good/Excellent), 5 (Excellent), 6 (Excellent/Near Mint), 7 (Near Mint), 8 (Near Mint/Mint), 9 (Mint), and 10 (Gem Mint). A card that receives a grade of ISA 10 is nearly flawless. This card has tremendous eye appeal that is unaffected by any minor print dots. It has all of its original gloss. The centering on the front of the card is between 50/50 and 55/45. The centering on the reverse of the card is no worse than 75/25. An ISA 10 possesses no staining and is in sharp focus.
