            Outside of the top grading companies, Hybrid Grading Approach (HGA) is a newer entrant in the card grading industry, bringing innovation and technology to the forefront. HGA uses computer software for initial grading assessments, aiming to provide more consistent and objective grading. They also offer custom-colored slabs tailored to the card or team colors, which is unique in the industry.

            HGA claims to have revolutionized the collectible card market with a novel software approach. This approach involves scanning, analyzing, and grading cards at high resolution without subjectivity, aiming to detect imperfections that human eyes may often overlook. However, as of 07/15/2024, the company has halted new submissions while they restructure their business model and platform.
