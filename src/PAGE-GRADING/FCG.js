            Forensic Card Grading (FCG) is based in Southlake, Texas, and they seek to provide a viable alternative to the main grading card companies without sacrificing the quality or look of the slabs. They focus on consistency and accuracy. They claim to be entirely objective with full transparency and fast turnaround times. They operate under a clearly defined set of rules for subgrades and utilize intense lighting and high magnification in the review process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microscopes with multiple light settings allow the graders to quickly change the intensity of the light and level of magnification to best suit that individual card. Graders are also provided overhead magnifying lamps, with multiple tools and lighting options for the graders can combine the right lighting and magnification to get the best look at each aspect of every card. Cards are graded on their merit and their merit alone, with no population control or worry about objectivity during the grading process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another unique element is they offer a single service level -- "Fast". This is currently priced at $14 per card for a 10-day or less turnaround time. They do not upcharge based on value, autographs, or subgrades. If cards are not shipped within the 10-day turnaround, they also offer a money-back guarantee. They use the industry standard 1-10-point scale, with 10 GEM MINT being the highest grade.
