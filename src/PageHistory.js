                        <h2>Overview Summary</h2>
                        <p>
                            Sports Trading Cards have a long and storied history that spans more than 150 years. According to Kings Research, the global sports trading cards market size was valued at $9.69 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $20.48 billion by 2030 growing at a CAGR of 9.01% from 2023 to 2030.  (See Figure 1)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to Card Ladder the total amount of money spent on cards has averaged around $200M per month (See Figure 2) and the total number of transactions has skyrocketed from a monthly average of 250,000 transactions in 2020; to 2 million transactions in 2022; and 4 million transactions per month in 2024. (See Figure 3)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Popularity of trading cards is determined by the subject represented on the card, their real-life accomplishments and short-term news coverage, as well as the specifics of the card. While vintage cards are truly a scarce commodity, modern-day manufacturers must artificially add value to their products to make them scarce. This is accomplished by including serial-numbered parallel sets, cards with game-worn memorabilia, autographs and more. Time can also increase scarcity because cards may be lost or destroyed.

                        <h2>How it Started</h2>
                        <p>
                            The entire concept of collecting cards emerged from Victorian-era sentimentality and a fascination with new-fangled color printing. In the 1870s and early 1900s, the popularization of "color lithography" or multi-color printing led to the increased popularity of the "trade card." The original "trade cards" were advertising cards that were packaged with cigarettes for the purpose of stiffening the packaging. Valued for their vibrant full-color imagery, the public began to collect these cards, storing their collections in scrapbooks and albums. The designs on the cards were often not product-related but were humorous or beautiful, depending on the perceived tastes of the consumer. People would often trade with each other to obtain a complete set, hence the origin of their name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first baseball cards were printed in the late 1860s by a sporting goods company when baseball became a professional sport. They were usually sold in packets of candy or tobacco products. Cigarette and candy companies started including baseball cards with their products to drive sales by capitalizing on the sport's popularity. Allen and Ginter in the U.S. in 1886 and British company W.D. & H.O. Wills in 1888 were the first tobacco companies to print advertisements. Companies of all kinds would insert these cards into product packaging as a prize.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By 1900 there were thousands of tobacco card sets manufactured by 300 different companies. The T206 set distributed by the American Tobacco Company in 1909 is considered by collectors to be the most popular set of all time. In 1933 the Goudey Gum Company of Boston issued baseball cards with players' biographies on the backs and was the first to put baseball cards in bubble gum. The 1933 Goudey set remains one of the most popular and affordable vintage sets to this day. World War II put an end to cigarette card production due to limited paper resources and after the war, cigarette cards never really made a comeback. Collectors in the US subsequently moved to collecting bubble gum cards.

                        <h2>Pre-World War II Era</h2>
                        <p>
                            Baseball was the dominant sport in the U.S. for the bulk of the 20th century and baseball cards make up nearly all pre-WWII cards. These cards were less for collectors than they were tools of advertising. Prior to the early 1930s, there were not many cards made because complete sets were not produced every year. It is difficult to find cards from the early part of the century and even harder to find cards in good condition -- as a result, even poorly graded cards can be relatively valuable. In the early 1930s, a card production boom occurred with the famous 1933 Goudey set leading the way.  (See Figures 10 & 11) There are still a relatively high number of cards in good condition nearly 100 years later from this time period.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sports cards originating as simple marketing inserts in tobacco products in the late 19th century have evolved into a dynamic aspect of sports culture -- from advertising tools to treasured collectibles. Initially, sports cards were not created with the intent of becoming collectibles. They were primarily marketing tools used by tobacco companies. The late 1800s was a period marked by a significant rise in the popularity of both smoking and professional sports. Tobacco companies saw an opportunity to capitalize on these trends by including cards in cigarette packs. These cards often referred to as "trade cards" served a dual purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, they provided structural support to the cigarette packaging, helping to prevent the cigarettes from being crushed. Second, from a marketing perspective, they were used to advertise the tobacco company's brand. The inclusion of popular figures like actors, actresses, and athletes on these cards was a strategic decision. It was a way to appeal to a broad audience and create a connection between the consumer and the brand. Athletes quickly became some of the most popular due in part to the growing interest in professional sports during this era and advances in media communications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Baseball was prominent during this time-period in the US, and the depiction of baseball players on these cards resonated with the public.  This popularity laid the groundwork for the eventual emergence of sports cards as a distinct category for mainstream collectors.  Early sports cards were quite different from how they are today, however.   They used to be more artistic in nature, featuring hand-drawn images and elaborate designs.   The back of the cards typically contained advertisements for the tobacco product or other information about the company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The earliest known baseball card was produced in 1865, and it was a souvenir "visiting card" handed out to fans and opposing teams.  Having won several city championships, the Brooklyn Atlantics dominated New York baseball in the early 1860s. That year, the Atlantics expanded their range and accepted a challenge from the Tri-Mountain Club held on Boston Common. Some three thousand spectators watched the visitors sprint away with a 107--16 victory.

                            During 1909-1911, the American Tobacco Company produced the T206 set which is one of the most iconic and valuable in the history of sports cards.  These cards were distributed in cigarette and tobacco packs as a promotional item.   The set's long production run and the variety of brands under the American Tobacco Company's umbrella contributed to the large number of cards and variations within the set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The T206 set of 1909-1911 is renowned for their artistic quality.   The cards feature vivid, colorful lithographs of players which are detailed and lifelike in their depictions.   Each card has the player's name and team at the bottom, with a variety of back designs featuring advertisements for different tobacco brands.  With over 500 cards, the T206 set is one of the most extensive pre-war sports cards sets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The set includes cards of some legendary figures in baseball history, like Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Cy Young, and Christy Mathewson.  (See Figures 12-15)  One of the most famous cards in the set, and indeed in the entire sports card collecting world, is the Honus Wagner card.  Wagner, a Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop, was one of the era's greatest players.  His card is extraordinarily rare, partly because Wagner objected to the use of his image, purportedly because he did not want to promote tobacco products to children.  This led to a limited production of his card, making it one of the rarest and most valuable sports cards in existence.  A Honus Wagner T206 card in good condition can fetch millions of dollars at auction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The T206 set is highly valued by collectors both for its historical significance and its rarity.  The age, condition, and rarity of individual cards can lead to substantial prices.  It's not just the famous players whose cards are valuable; even lesser-known players can command high prices due to the set's overall rarity and significance in the history of sports cards.  The T206 set is a cornerstone of sports card collecting, representing a unique intersection of art, history, and sport.   Its enduring legacy is a testament to the cultural impact of baseball in the early 20th century and the evolving nature of collectibles over time.

                            The evolution of sports cards in the early 20th century marked a significant shift in their purpose and appeal, transforming them from simple promotional items into a more engaging and informative collectible.  One of the most pivotal developments was the addition of player statistics and biographical information on the cards.   This innovation was more than just a design change; it fundamentally altered how collectors interacted with the cards.  By including stats like batting averages, home runs, and pitching records, along with personal information like birthplace, height, and weight, the cards became a source of information and learning.  The inclusion of this data added an educational component to collecting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This period also saw a surge in the popularity of professional sports, particularly baseball.  The growing media coverage of sports and the rise of iconic athletes helped fuel interest in sports cards.  The addition of statistics and biographical information turned sports card collecting into a more dynamic hobby.   Collectors began to seek specific cards based on a player's performance and career achievements.   This also introduced the concept of card value being tied not just to rarity and condition, but also to a player's success and popularity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alongside these informational additions, there were also changes in the design and aesthetics of the cards.  The cards from this era often featured more sophisticated and varied designs compared to the earlier trade cards, reflecting advances in printing technology and design trends.  While baseball cards were still predominant, this era also saw the expansion of sports cards to include other sports like football, boxing, and basketball, reflecting the growing popularity of these sports in American culture.

                        <p>
                            The Pre-World War II era was a transformative period for sports cards, marked by a shift towards a younger audience, the inclusion of statistical and biographical information, and a broadening in the types of sports represented.  These changes made sports cards more informative, engaging, and reflective of the growing cultural significance of professional sports in America.

                        <h2>Post-War Boom Era</h2>
                        <p>
                            After World War II, the Leaf Candy Company, Bowman Gum Company and Topps Gum Company got into the sports card business, leading to a golden era of cards in the 1950s.  In 1948, Bowman released the first official basketball set (See Figure 16), and in 1950 they introduced bubble gum into the packaging of sports cards. The Fleer Corporation, founded by Frank H. Fleer in 1885, was the first company to successfully manufacture bubble gum; it remained a family-owned enterprise until 1989.  Fleer became known as a maker of sports cards, starting in 1923 with the production of baseball cards. Fleer also released American football (1960) and basketball (1986) card sets through its history.  The introduction of bubble gum into the packaging of sports cards in the early 1950s by Bowman Gum Company represented a significant milestone in the history of sports cards, both in terms of marketing and cultural impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The combination of sports cards and gum was an instant hit among consumers, particularly children and teenagers.  The idea of getting gum along with cards featuring their favorite athletes was appealing and added a new dimension to the experience of collecting sports cards.  Because there was no emphasis on keeping cards in good condition, however, there is a natural scarcity of cards in mint condition from this era.  Kids at the time had no idea that they might be valuable in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bowman's success caught the attention of other companies, leading to increased competition in the sports card industry.  Topps, another gum company, emerged as a major competitor.  This rivalry led to innovations in card design, quality, and content, as each company sought to outdo the other in attracting collectors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1950, Topps Chewing Gum Inc. began inserting trading cards into their packaging.  Topps produced its first baseball trading card set in 1951, with the resulting design resembling that of playing cards.  In 1952, Topps began producing the sports trading cards that we know today, which included a player biography, records, and other statistics.  This is one of the most popular sets of all time; its most valued piece was 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle #311, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as Mantle's rookie card, though he had in fact appeared in the 1951 Bowman Baseball set.  On August 28, 2022, a Mickey Mantle baseball card (Topps; #311; SGC MT 9.5) was sold for $12.600 million.  This original set -- which contains the rookie card for Mickey Mantle -- is among the most valuable of all time.  (See Figures 17 & 18)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the mid-1950s Topps was the dominant force and the most iconic cards from the era are Topps baseball cards.  Following the success in baseball cards, the concept was expanded to include other sports as well.  This diversification helped popularize these sports and their players among a broader audience, contributing to the growth of sports card collecting as a multi-sport hobby.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Topps purchased their chief competitor, Bowman Gum, in 1956, and Topps was the leader in the trading card industry from 1956 to 1980.  Many of the cards from this era have become highly collectible due to their historical significance, nostalgia, and the stars they featured.  This period also saw further evolution in the content of cards.  Companies began to experiment with different types of imagery, statistics, and player information, continually enhancing the appeal and informational value of sports cards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1960s and 1970s were a period of significant evolution and sophistication in the world of sports cards.  This era saw various changes and innovations that helped shape the hobby into a more mature and diverse market.  Improvements in printing technology during this era allowed for better quality and more visually appealing sports cards.  There was a shift towards using actual photographs of players rather than illustrations.  Card manufacturers began producing larger sets with more players included.   This allowed for a wider representation of athletes, including not just stars but also lesser-known players, which appealed to a broader range of collectors and fans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While baseball cards continued to be the mainstay, there was a notable increase in the production of cards for other sports like football, basketball, hockey, and even non-traditional sports.  This diversification mirrored the growing popularity of these sports in American culture.  Card companies started to introduce special editions and subsets within their main series.  The concept of the rookie card (the first card of a player) began to gain more importance.  Collectors started to place a higher value on these cards, speculating that they would increase in value as the player's career progressed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1960s and 1970s saw the hobby of card collecting start to be taken more seriously. It wasn't just a child's pastime anymore; adults were also actively participating.   This shift was partly due to the growing nostalgia for cards and the realization that cards could be valuable collectibles.  There was a growth in the secondary market for sports cards, with more trade shows and conventions being organized.  These events provided platforms for collectors to buy, sell, and trade cards, and helped to cultivate a community around the hobby.  The 1960s and 1970s were critical in shaping the sports card industry.  Advances in technology, diversification of content, a focus on photography, the emergence of special editions and rookie cards, and the rise of a more serious collecting community all contributed to the evolution and increased sophistication of sports cards during this period.

                        <h2>Junk Wax Era</h2>
                        <p>
                            The 1980s marked a significant era in the history of sports cards, characterized by a surge in popularity and the introduction of various innovations.  Companies began experimenting with new technologies and materials to make cards more attractive and unique.  This included the introduction of holographic cards, which had a shimmering, three-dimensional appearance, and foil-stamped cards, which featured metallic accents for a more premium look.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This decade brought about key developments that not only transformed the sports card industry but also shaped the collecting community.  The 1980s saw a boom in the number of card shops and the prevalence of sports card conventions.  The 1980s was a decade of innovation in card design and production.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This decade witnessed the entry of new companies into the sports card market, increasing competition and variety.  Card companies, including Fleer, Donruss, Score and Upper Deck - entered the space and met increased demand with overproduction.  Brands like Upper Deck, which debuted in 1989, brought new ideas and quality standards to the industry, further invigorating the market. (See Figure 22)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1980s saw a shift in the perception of sports cards from simple collectibles to potential investment pieces because the monetary worth of earlier cards began to increase.  People began to regret the loss of their now-valuable childhood cards, so more people saved their collections in hopes of seeing an increase in value.  Tremendous growth in the industry in 1980's as cards from earlier years became valuable.  The increasing value of rare and vintage cards, along with the popularity of rookie cards of emerging stars, led collectors to view sports cards as a form of financial investment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As sports card collecting experienced a surge in popularity, companies produced more cards to meet demand.  Collectors in the 1980's knew how to keep cards in top condition this has resulted in few valuable cards from this era.  In most cases, it's only the cards graded as a gem mint condition that fetch high price because there were too many cards produced, and too many cards still exist in excellent condition.  This overproduction of cards combined with an interest in protecting them led to most cards from the 1980s and 1990s being pretty much worthless today.

                            The 1980s was a transformative decade for sports cards, characterized by a surge in popularity, community building through card shops and conventions, and significant innovations in card design and technology.   These developments not only enhanced the appeal of card collecting but also laid the foundation for the modern sports card industry today.

                            The 1990s carried the momentum from the 80s, and marked a pivotal era in the history of sports cards due to the unprecedented growth, technological advancements, and key trends that profoundly influenced the industry and collecting community over time decade.  The 1990s witnessed significant   advancements in card manufacturing technology - this led to the production of higher quality, more sophisticated cards featuring advanced printing techniques, better quality paper, and unique designs.

                            Premium and limited-edition card series, with higher price points and superior quality, became popular among collectors.  A major trend of the 1990s was the introduction of insert cards, or "chase cards," which were randomly included in card packs.  These included autographed cards, memorabilia cards (containing pieces of player jerseys, bats, etc.), serial numbered cards, and holographic or foil cards.

                            The 1990s saw the expansion of the sports card market beyond the traditional baseball, basketball, and football cards.  The market saw the dominance of major brands like Topps, Upper Deck, and Fleer, (See Figures 24 & 25) alongside new entrants that further diversified the market.  In 1995, Fleer acquired the trading card company SkyBox International.  This competition led to constant innovation in card design and marketing strategies to capture the interest of collectors.

                            The 1990s continued the trend of viewing sports cards as potential investments.  This period also saw heightened interest in grading services, which assessed and certified the condition of cards, adding to their perceived investment value.  The condition of the card is critical, and there are four areas of interest in determining a card's condition.   Centering, corners, edges and surface are taken into consideration, for imperfections, such as color spots and blurred images, and wear, such as creases, scratches and tears, when determining a trading card's value.  Trading cards have the most value when they are officially graded -- or ranked on their condition -- with 1 being "poor" and 10 being "gem mint." The most popular grading services are provided by Beckett and PSA.

                            The 1990s experienced an increase in licensing agreements between card companies and sports leagues, as well as direct endorsements from athletes.  This led to better representation of players and teams on cards and more official and authentic products.  Autographs obtained by card manufacturers have become the most collected baseball cards in the hobby's history.   This started in 1990 in baseball when Upper Deck randomly inserted autographs of Reggie Jackson into boxes.   They are commonly referred to as "Certified Autographed Inserts" or "CAI's", and this has created the most authentic autographs in existence.

                            In 1991 Topps ceased packaging gum with their baseball cards, making many collectors happy that their cards could no longer be damaged by gum stains.  The following year, in 1992, Topps ceased using heavily waxed paper to wrap their packs of cards and began using cellophane plastic exclusively, thus eliminating the possibility of wax stains on the top and bottom cards in the packs.

                        <p>
                            As the internet became more accessible in the late 90s, it began to influence the sports card industry.  Online forums and marketplaces emerged, allowing collectors to connect, trade, and sell cards more easily on a global scale.  Towards the end of the 1990s, the sports card market experienced a significant correction.  The oversupply of cards, along with waning interest, led to a decline in both the value of cards and the number of active collectors.  While the era introduced exciting innovations and expanded the sports card market, it also faced challenges that led to significant changes in the industry.

                        <h2>Modern Evolutions & Creation of Scarcity</h2>
                        <p>
                            Starting in 1997, companies responded by introducing "insert" cards with limited print runs, and eventually those cards - often with autographs and/or game-used memorabilia - became highly sought after.  Inserts offer an artificial scarcity because of their limited print runs.  This led to demand for the rarest cards, some of which are now among the most valuable sports cards overall.  During this time, basketball cards became higher in demand as baseball cards fell in popularity, riding the growing popularity of the NBA and a relative decline in baseball attendance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Continuing the trend from previous decades, the 2000s and 2010s saw further advancements in printing technology.   Cards were produced with even higher quality materials, intricate designs, and innovative features like holograms, reflective surfaces, and textured elements.  Beyond standard player cards, the industry saw an increase in specialized cards.  These included limited edition series, cards focusing on specific moments or milestones in sports, and cards targeted towards niche interests within the sports world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rise of the internet dramatically changed the sports card industry.  Online marketplaces and trading platforms emerged, making it easier for collectors to buy, sell, and trade cards globally.  This digital shift also facilitated the sharing of information about cards, values, and trends.  As the market matured, the importance of card condition and authenticity grew.  Professional grading services such as PSA and BGS (Beckett) became key players in the industry, providing standardized evaluations of card condition and thus influencing their market value.  The concept of rookie cards continued to be a major focus, with collectors often speculating on the future success of young athletes.  The potential investment value of these rookie cards often drove market trends.

                            In 2005, the long-standing sports card producer Fleer went bankrupt and was bought out by Upper Deck.  Not long after that, Donruss lost its MLB license.  Since 2009, Topps has held exclusive rights to produce MLB-licensed baseball cards.  Topps is the preeminent licensed trading card brand that has serviced collectors, fans, and retailers for more than 70 years.  Topps was acquired by Fanatics in 2022 and has become the cornerstone trading card brand within the Fanatics Collectibles business.

                            In recent years, Panini has taken the trading card industry by storm.  Established more than 50 years ago (1961) in Modena, Italy, the Panini Group has subsidiaries throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States. Panini is the international brand leader within the world of sticker and trading card collectables with over 1,000 collection launches each year and one of the leading publishers of children magazines and books, comics, manga and graphic novels, in Europe and Latin America with over 7.000 publications yearly.

                            In January 2009, Panini acquired an exclusive license to produce NBA trading cards and stickers, effective with the 2009-10 NBA season.  In March 2009, Panini acquired the US trading card manufacturer Donruss Playoff LP.  With it, Panini inherited Donruss' NFL and NFLPA licenses.  Panini signed an exclusive agreement with five-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers as its official company spokesman and global trading card ambassador in 2009.  Bryant's special affiliation to Panini goes back to his time growing up in Italy where he collected Italian football stickers.

                            The 2020s have been a groundbreaking era for the sports card industry, marked by unprecedented changes and innovations.  This decade is characterized by technological advancements, shifts in collector behavior, and the influence of global events.  The global pandemic had a significant impact on the sports card market.   With more people staying at home, there was a surge in collecting as a hobby.  This led to increased demand and prices for cards, especially for rare and vintage items.

                            The 2020s saw the emergence of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and digital sports cards.  These blockchain-based cards provide a new way of collecting, trading, and owning digital assets, revolutionizing the concept of sports card ownership and rarity.  The use of analytics and big data in sports card collecting became more prevalent.  Collectors and investors began utilizing data-driven approaches to assess the value of cards, predict market trends, and make informed purchasing decisions.  The proliferation of online marketplaces and mobile applications dedicated to sports cards made the hobby more accessible.  These platforms enabled easier buying, selling, and trading of cards, as well as community engagement and education.

                            The 2020s represent a transformative period for the sports card industry, driven by technological innovation, shifts in social and environmental consciousness, and the expanding global reach of sports.  These developments have not only changed how collectors engage with their hobby but also broadened the cultural and economic significance of sports cards.  From the tobacco cards of the 19th century to the digital and NFT-based cards of the 21st, sports cards have consistently mirrored the evolving trends in sports, technology, and society.  The enduring appeal of sports cards lies in their ability to connect generations, serve as a medium for education and investment, and offer a tangible piece of sports history.

                            Today, basically the only cards worth pursuing are inserts and parallels, (See Figures 27-30) with entire sets and boxes made up entirely of limited print runs, autographs and patch cards.  Companies learned from their mistakes, and today production volumes are closely controlled to produce an artificial sense of scarcity and drive up card values.

                            This could be a new type of junk wax era -- there is a clear overabundance of "rare" cards which means none of the cards are effectively rare.  There are now so many parallels and subsets - and slight variations of cards - that it is often difficult to narrow down the best rookie cards for certain players.  Additionally, because the players from this era are still active and playing, there is a lot of price fluctuation based on current player and team performance and cards from this era are certainly the most speculative.

                            Trading cards overall are still recovering from the unprecedented boom in popularity during the pandemic. (See Figure 34)  Transaction volumes continue to be elevated, but overall price levels remain in a bear market.  The Hobby experienced a huge resurgence during the pandemic which caused values to soar rapidly.  During lockdown, many people took a renewed interest in trading cards, and there were millions more submissions for grading services than usual.  The increased demand led to PSA temporarily hiking up its prices to keep things under control.

                            Currently, there are many different types of sports card collectors, which supports a rich and vibrant community.  A set collector seeks out every card from a specific set. This approach is one of the best ways to start your card collection. You identify a set that interests you and collect every card in the release, including all subsets and inserts.  With this approach, you end up collecting a variety of card types including rookie cards, parallels, and rare inserts.

                            A player collector is driven to collect a complete set of cards for a specific player.  The thrill is trying to collect all the cards you can. Depending on the player you're targeting, you'll collect cards produced during their playing career, post-retirement, or cards from a particular set. This approach allows you to develop a deeply personal relationship with a player throughout their career and beyond.

                        <p>
                            The team collector seeks out cards of a specific team. Through each unique card of a particular group, you'll see how a team has developed through the seasons, an accounting of prominent players, long-tenured players, and the various accomplishments your team and its players have achieved. Depending on the team and era, you could be looking at the difference of tens of thousands of cards produced for a specific team.

                            Chasing the Rainbow (See Figure 35) is a modern collecting phenomenon where you collect different color Parallel cards of a player. Depending on the player and Parallels, including Autos, a complete Rainbow collection could consist of many cards. Additionally, some collectors chase only the Paper or Chrome Rainbows or combine both. One of the main reasons why many collectors Chase the Rainbow is because of how aesthetically pleasing these cards are on display.

                        <p>
                            Vintage collectors only focus on vintage cards dating from around 1979 or earlier. This approach combines Set, Player, and Team collecting under a single pursuit. Equal parts nostalgia and anthropology, Vintage Collecting is all about finding the card you're chasing in the best condition for the best price.

                            Prospecting is collecting cards produced of young players who have yet to reach the majors. In many ways, Prospecting is all about banking as many lottery cards as possible.  The emphasis on Rookie Cards is a major primary focus for many sports card collectors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, the completist is the most dedicated and ambitious collector type. The completist collector is driven to possess every card of a particular set, year, team, player, or category. If they collect 2021 Topps Chrome Baseball, the Completist will hunt down every card from that Checklist -- including every Base Card, Parallel, Auto, etc. Common Cards from a given set will have little value for many collectors, but for a Completist, whose aim is to complete each set, the Common Cards will have significant value since they cannot complete the set without them.

                            What does the future hold for trading cards? Virtual basketball cards have recently appeared on the scene and have been well received by fans. These digital cards feature "moments," or floating digital cubes that feature a video highlight of a specific player. These are made possible by a technology called "blockchain," which assigns each clip a certificate of ownership which cannot be copied or deleted. These moments sell for around $10-$20 each.

                        <h2>Retail vs. Hobby Box Products</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hobby boxes are higher-end boxes of sports cards that will often include more chase cards than retail boxes. Hobby boxes also tend to have higher price tags on them since they will give you a better chance to pull sports cards that could be more valuable than those found in retail boxes.  You'll also find special releases of hobby products, including 1st Off The Line products, Sapphire products, Jumbo products, Super Jumbo products, HTA products, Choice products, among others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A retail box is the type of sports card box you will find at most big-box stores such as Walmart and Target. Retail products can come in a variety of configurations, including Blaster Boxes, Mega Boxes, Value Boxes, Retail Boxes, Multi-Packs, Value Packs, Cello Packs, Rack Packs, Retail Packs, Factory Sets, Hanger Boxes, among others.  Unlike hobby boxes that are designed to come with more chase cards in them, the chase cards in retail boxes will be few and far between. It's possible to open multiple packs from a retail box without finding a single chase card.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hobby boxes are targeted for the hardcore collector, and generally focus on the premium aspects of a product like autographs and memorabilia cards. Odds of finding rare cards are typically higher.  Most hobby products guarantee one signature or relic per box whereas retail blaster boxes do not carry such minimum guarantees. Plus, often hobby boxes are the only product that contain certain card varieties and parallels.  Typically, high-end products are hobby-exclusive and will not be available in a retail format.

                        <p>
                            The introduction and popularity of parallel, variants, and refractor cards have had a significant influence on the sports card market. The rarity and uniqueness of these cards have added a new dimension to card valuations. The price of a card is no longer determined solely by the player it represents or its condition. The type of parallel or refractor, the scarcity, and even the aesthetic appeal can significantly impact a card's market value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Base cards are the building blocks of any sports card collection, and they make up the set's numbering scheme and sometimes reference how many are in the set.  Insert cards, sometimes called "chase cards" are tucked within sports card packs that were introduced in the 1990s. These cards are not typically part of a base set numbering system and often showcase unique themes, different designs, or other special features to make them distinct from the set with which they are packed.  They include autographed cards, relic cards, parallel cards, and special edition cards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Parallel cards offer an intriguing twist to base cards. These cards will mirror the design and layout of a base card, but with distinguishing features that may be minor or could significantly change the look of the card. Common parallel variations include color schemes, borders, or foil accents.  Refractors are parallel cards with a reflective layer that can reflect light in a rainbow pattern at the proper angle that have been produced by various trading card companies for more than 25 years. These cards often appear in their own numbering scheme and are further divided by difference in color or another factor that allows the publisher to make more variants for a card set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most rare among the refractors is the SuperFractor, which is usually a term reserved for a single-card population print. Like some refractors, these cards will almost always call out their uniqueness as "1/1" or "One of One" tags on the card. This feature is often paired with relics and game-worn components.  Companies that produce SuperFractors will sometimes release the one card directly to market through their website, commanding their own price for this one-of-a-kind card. Other companies will place them into the general population, releasing details about how rare the card is and the percentage chance of getting this treasure by opening a whole lot of boxes of cards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While base cards typically have a numbering scheme that shows which number among the set all copies of that card represent, special serial numbers for limited edition cards instead list the number for individual cards among a single print of that card. There can also be additional value derived from cards that have a lower serial number from a set.  When a card is part of a limited population, they will have a number that is not referencing the box's set, but the individual card's number from the printed population of the same card.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Autographed cards are some of the most sought-after sports cards. They contain the signature of the featured athlete, typically signed directly on the card. Panini, Topps, and Upper Deck often include autographed cards in their sets, and these cards carry a premium due to their personal touch from athletes.  Relics in sports cards are small pieces of game-used jerseys or equipment that are embedded within the card. These relics are highly collectible and among the most sought-after by sports card enthusiasts and collectors since they provide a tangible connection to the player or team and offer a unique piece of memorabilia that can't be found elsewhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Die-cut sports cards are different from regular sports cards in several ways. First, they are often cut into unique shapes that are different from the regular rectangular shape of traditional sports cards. They often have unusual design elements to make them more visually appealing and appropriate for their peculiar shape. Die-Cut cards also tend to be rarer due to their special status, and they are often also refractors and/or relic cards to just add further value to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, booklet cards are unique, fold-out cards that resemble a small book. They often feature a combination of elements, such as autographs, game-used memorabilia, and player photos or artwork. Booklet cards are produced for special events in limited quantities and usually numbered to indicate their scarcity.  The value of booklet cards is influenced by factors such as the featured players, the overall design, and the rarity of the card.

                            During the pandemic, there was a massive increase of new collectors and grading baseball cards exploded.  Grading has become an essential aspect of the collectibles market, providing authenticity and value to cards.  There are many grading companies to choose from, but just a handful that have strong reputations in the industry:  Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), Beckett Grading Services (BGS), Sportscard Guaranty Corporation (SGC), Certified Guaranty Corporation (CGC), and Hybrid Grading Approach (HGA).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Founded in 1991, PSA has become one of the largest and most respected card grading services in the world.  They handle more than 75% of all cards graded in the US, and in the first half of 2023 alone PSA graded over 6.4 million cards out of an industry total of roughly 8 million. (See Figure 40, Source: Edge) It is known for its detailed grading scale ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 being a virtually perfect card.  PSA's encapsulation process preserves the card's condition while ensuring its authenticity. Their grading system is widely recognized and trusted, often leading to a higher resale value for cards graded by PSA. They also offer a comprehensive database of graded cards, providing valuable information for collectors.

                            Beckett is a well-known name in the sports card industry, with its grading service, BGS, established in 1999. They are especially renowned for grading newer cards.  BGS uses a unique grading scale that includes half-point grades, offering a more nuanced assessment of a card's condition. Their graded cards are encapsulated in tamper-evident cases. Beckett is particularly known for its thorough assessment of a card's corners, edges, surface, and centering.

                            SGC has been in the grading business since 1998 and has built a reputation for its focus on older, vintage cards.  SGC is known for its straightforward grading scale and fast turnaround times. They provide a tuxedo-like black matting within their encapsulation, which enhances the card's visual appeal. Their focus on vintage cards makes them a go-to for collectors of historic baseball memorabilia.

                            While newer to the sports card grading scene compared to others, CGC has quickly established a strong reputation, leveraging its expertise from comic book grading.  CGC stands out for its state-of-the-art holder design, which offers superior protection and display qualities. They are also known for their transparency, providing detailed reports on the grading process for each card.
                        </p>

                            HGA is a newer entrant in the card grading industry, bringing innovation and technology to the forefront.  HGA uses computer software for initial grading assessments, aiming to provide more consistent and objective grading. They also offer custom-colored slabs tailored to the card or team colors, which is unique in the industry.  HGA claims to have revolutionized the collectible card market with a novel software approach. This approach involves scanning, analyzing, and grading cards at high resolution without subjectivity, aiming to detect imperfections that human eyes may often overlook.
