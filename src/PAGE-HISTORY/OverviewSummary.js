            Popularity of trading cards is determined by the subject represented on the card, their real-life accomplishments and short-term news coverage, as well as the specifics of the card. While vintage cards are truly a scarce commodity, modern-day manufacturers must artificially add value to their products to make them scarce. This is accomplished by including serial-numbered parallel sets, cards with game-worn memorabilia, autographs and more. Time can also increase scarcity because cards may be lost or destroyed.
