            What does the future hold for trading cards? Virtual basketball cards have recently appeared on the scene and have been well received by fans. These digital cards feature "moments," or floating digital cubes that feature a video highlight of a specific player. These are made possible by a technology called "blockchain," which assigns each clip a certificate of ownership that cannot be copied or deleted. These moments sell for around $10-$20 each.
