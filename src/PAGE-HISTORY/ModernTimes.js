            Starting in 1997, companies responded by introducing "insert" cards with limited print runs, and eventually, those cards—often with autographs and/or game-used memorabilia—became highly sought after. Inserts offer an artificial scarcity because of their limited print runs. This led to demand for the rarest cards, some of which are now among the most valuable sports cards overall. During this time, basketball cards became higher in demand as baseball cards fell in popularity, riding the growing popularity of the NBA and a relative decline in baseball attendance.

            Continuing the trend from previous decades, the 2000s and 2010s saw further advancements in printing technology. Cards were produced with even higher quality materials, intricate designs, and innovative features like holograms, reflective surfaces, and textured elements. Beyond standard player cards, the industry saw an increase in specialized cards. These included limited edition series, cards focusing on specific moments or milestones in sports, and cards targeted towards niche interests within the sports world.

            The rise of the internet dramatically changed the sports card industry. Online marketplaces and trading platforms emerged, making it easier for collectors to buy, sell, and trade cards globally. This digital shift also facilitated the sharing of information about cards, values, and trends. As the market matured, the importance of card condition and authenticity grew. Professional grading services such as PSA and BGS (Beckett) became key players in the industry, providing standardized evaluations of card condition and thus influencing their market value. The concept of rookie cards continued to be a major focus, with collectors often speculating on the future success of young athletes. The potential investment value of these rookie cards often drove market trends.

            In 2005, the long-standing sports card producer Fleer went bankrupt and was bought out by Upper Deck. Not long after that, Donruss lost its MLB license. Since 2009, Topps has held exclusive rights to produce MLB-licensed baseball cards. Topps is the preeminent licensed trading card brand that has serviced collectors, fans, and retailers for more than 70 years. Topps was acquired by Fanatics in 2022 and has become the cornerstone trading card brand within the Fanatics Collectibles business.

            In recent years, Panini has taken the trading card industry by storm. Established more than 50 years ago (1961) in Modena, Italy, the Panini Group has subsidiaries throughout Europe, Latin America, and the United States. Panini is the international brand leader within the world of sticker and trading card collectables with over 1,000 collection launches each year and one of the leading publishers of children's magazines and books, comics, manga, and graphic novels in Europe and Latin America with over 7,000 publications yearly.

            In January 2009, Panini acquired an exclusive license to produce NBA trading cards and stickers, effective with the 2009-10 NBA season. In March 2009, Panini acquired the US trading card manufacturer Donruss Playoff LP. With it, Panini inherited Donruss' NFL and NFLPA licenses. Panini signed an exclusive agreement with five-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers as its official company spokesman and global trading card ambassador in 2009. Bryant's special affiliation to Panini goes back to his time growing up in Italy where he collected Italian football stickers.

            The 2020s have been a groundbreaking era for the sports card industry, marked by unprecedented changes and innovations. This decade is characterized by technological advancements, shifts in collector behavior, and the influence of global events. The global pandemic had a significant impact on the sports card market. With more people staying at home, there was a surge in collecting as a hobby. This led to increased demand and prices for cards, especially for rare and vintage items.

            The 2020s saw the emergence of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and digital sports cards. These blockchain-based cards provide a new way of collecting, trading, and owning digital assets, revolutionizing the concept of sports card ownership and rarity. The use of analytics and big data in sports card collecting became more prevalent. Collectors and investors began utilizing data-driven approaches to assess the value of cards, predict market trends, and make informed purchasing decisions. The proliferation of online marketplaces and mobile applications dedicated to sports cards made the hobby more accessible. These platforms enabled easier buying, selling, and trading of cards, as well as community engagement and education.

            The 2020s represent a transformative period for the sports card industry, driven by technological innovation, shifts in social and environmental consciousness, and the expanding global reach of sports. These developments have not only changed how collectors engage with their hobby but also broadened the cultural and economic significance of sports cards. From the tobacco cards of the 19th century to the digital and NFT-based cards of the 21st, sports cards have consistently mirrored the evolving trends in sports, technology, and society. The enduring appeal of sports cards lies in their ability to connect generations, serve as a medium for education and investment, and offer a tangible piece of sports history.

            Today, basically the only cards worth pursuing are inserts and parallels, (See Figures 27-30) with entire sets and boxes made up entirely of limited print runs, autographs, and patch cards. Companies learned from their mistakes, and today production volumes are closely controlled to produce an artificial sense of scarcity and drive up card values.

            This could be a new type of junk wax era—there is a clear overabundance of "rare" cards which means none of the cards are effectively rare. There are now so many parallels and subsets—and slight variations of cards—that it is often difficult to narrow down the best rookie cards for certain players. Additionally, because the players from this era are still active and playing, there is a lot of price fluctuation based on current player and team performance, and cards from this era are certainly the most speculative.
        </p>

            Trading cards overall are still recovering from the unprecedented boom in popularity during the pandemic. (See Figure 34) Transaction volumes continue to be elevated, but overall price levels remain in a bear market. The Hobby experienced a huge resurgence during the pandemic which caused values to soar rapidly. During lockdown, many people took a renewed interest in trading cards, and there were millions more submissions for grading services than usual. The increased demand led to PSA temporarily hiking up its prices to keep things under control.

            Currently, there are many different types of sports card collectors, which supports a rich and vibrant community. A set collector seeks out every card from a specific set. This approach is one of the best ways to start your card collection. You identify a set that interests you and collect every card in the release, including all subsets and inserts. With this approach, you end up collecting a variety of card types including rookie cards, parallels, and rare inserts.

            A player collector is driven to collect a complete set of cards for a specific player. The thrill is trying to collect all the cards you can. Depending on the player you're targeting, you'll collect cards produced during their playing career, post-retirement, or cards from a particular set. This approach allows you to develop a deeply personal relationship with a player throughout their career and beyond.
        </p>

            The team collector seeks out cards of a specific team. Through each unique card of a particular group, you'll see how a team has developed through the seasons, an accounting of prominent players, long-tenured players, and the various accomplishments your team and its players have achieved. Depending on the team and era, you could be looking at the difference of tens of thousands of cards produced for a specific team.

            Chasing the Rainbow (See Figure 35) is a modern collecting phenomenon where you collect different color Parallel cards of a player. Depending on the player and Parallels, including Autos, a complete Rainbow collection could consist of many cards. Additionally, some collectors chase only the Paper or Chrome Rainbows or combine both. One of the main reasons why many collectors Chase the Rainbow is because of how aesthetically pleasing these cards are on display.

            Vintage collectors only focus on vintage cards dating from around 1979 or earlier. This approach combines Set, Player, and Team collecting under a single pursuit. Equal parts nostalgia and anthropology, Vintage Collecting is all about finding the card you're chasing in the best condition for the best price.

            Prospecting is collecting cards produced of young players who have yet to reach the majors. In many ways, Prospecting is all about banking as many lottery cards as possible. The emphasis on Rookie Cards is a major primary focus for many sports card collectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the completist is the most dedicated and ambitious collector type. The completist collector is driven to possess every card of a particular set, year, team, player, or category. If they collect 2021 Topps Chrome Baseball, the Completist will hunt down every card from that Checklist—including every Base Card, Parallel, Auto, etc. Common Cards from a given set will have little value for many collectors, but for a Completist, whose aim is to complete each set, the Common Cards will have significant value since they cannot complete the set without them.
