        <h2>Post-War Boom Era</h2>
        <p>
            After World War II, the Leaf Candy Company, Bowman Gum Company, and Topps Gum Company got into the sports card business, leading to a golden era of cards in the 1950s. In 1948, Bowman released the first official basketball set (See Figure 16), and in 1950 they introduced bubble gum into the packaging of sports cards. The Fleer Corporation, founded by Frank H. Fleer in 1885, was the first company to successfully manufacture bubble gum; it remained a family-owned enterprise until 1989. Fleer became known as a maker of sports cards, starting in 1923 with the production of baseball cards. Fleer also released American football (1960) and basketball (1986) card sets through its history. The introduction of bubble gum into the packaging of sports cards in the early 1950s by Bowman Gum Company represented a significant milestone in the history of sports cards, both in terms of marketing and cultural impact.

            The combination of sports cards and gum was an instant hit among consumers, particularly children and teenagers. The idea of getting gum along with cards featuring their favorite athletes was appealing and added a new dimension to the experience of collecting sports cards. Because there was no emphasis on keeping cards in good condition, however, there is a natural scarcity of cards in mint condition from this era. Kids at the time had no idea that they might be valuable in the future.

            Bowman's success caught the attention of other companies, leading to increased competition in the sports card industry. Topps, another gum company, emerged as a major competitor. This rivalry led to innovations in card design, quality, and content, as each company sought to outdo the other in attracting collectors.

            In 1950, Topps Chewing Gum Inc. began inserting trading cards into their packaging. Topps produced its first baseball trading card set in 1951, with the resulting design resembling that of playing cards. In 1952, Topps began producing the sports trading cards that we know today, which included a player biography, records, and other statistics. This is one of the most popular sets of all time; its most valued piece was 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle #311, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as Mantle's rookie card, though he had in fact appeared in the 1951 Bowman Baseball set. On August 28, 2022, a Mickey Mantle baseball card (Topps; #311; SGC MT 9.5) was sold for $12.600 million. This original set — which contains the rookie card for Mickey Mantle — is among the most valuable of all time. (See Figures 17 & 18)

            By the mid-1950s, Topps was the dominant force, and the most iconic cards from the era are Topps baseball cards. Following the success in baseball cards, the concept was expanded to include other sports as well. This diversification helped popularize these sports and their players among a broader audience, contributing to the growth of sports card collecting as a multi-sport hobby.

            Topps purchased their chief competitor, Bowman Gum, in 1956, and Topps was the leader in the trading card industry from 1956 to 1980. Many of the cards from this era have become highly collectible due to their historical significance, nostalgia, and the stars they featured. This period also saw further evolution in the content of cards. Companies began to experiment with different types of imagery, statistics, and player information, continually enhancing the appeal and informational value of sports cards.

            The 1960s and 1970s were a period of significant evolution and sophistication in the world of sports cards. This era saw various changes and innovations that helped shape the hobby into a more mature and diverse market. Improvements in printing technology during this era allowed for better quality and more visually appealing sports cards. There was a shift towards using actual photographs of players rather than illustrations. Card manufacturers began producing larger sets with more players included. This allowed for a wider representation of athletes, including not just stars but also lesser-known players, which appealed to a broader range of collectors and fans.

            While baseball cards continued to be the mainstay, there was a notable increase in the production of cards for other sports like football, basketball, hockey, and even non-traditional sports. This diversification mirrored the growing popularity of these sports in American culture. Card companies started to introduce special editions and subsets within their main series. The concept of the rookie card (the first card of a player) began to gain more importance. Collectors started to place a higher value on these cards, speculating that they would increase in value as the player's career progressed.

            The 1960s and 1970s saw the hobby of card collecting start to be taken more seriously. It wasn't just a child's pastime anymore; adults were also actively participating. This shift was partly due to the growing nostalgia for cards and the realization that cards could be valuable collectibles. There was a growth in the secondary market for sports cards, with more trade shows and conventions being organized. These events provided platforms for collectors to buy, sell, and trade cards, and helped to cultivate a community around the hobby. The 1960s and 1970s were critical in shaping the sports card industry. Advances in technology, diversification of content, a focus on photography, the emergence of special editions and rookie cards, and the rise of a more serious collecting community all contributed to the evolution and increased sophistication of sports cards during this period.
