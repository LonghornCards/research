            The entire concept of collecting cards emerged from Victorian-era sentimentality and a fascination with new-fangled color printing. In the 1870s and early 1900s, the popularization of "color lithography" or multi-color printing led to the increased popularity of the "trade card." The original "trade cards" were advertising cards that were packaged with cigarettes for the purpose of stiffening the packaging. Valued for their vibrant full-color imagery, the public began to collect these cards, storing their collections in scrapbooks and albums. The designs on the cards were often not product-related but were humorous or beautiful, depending on the perceived tastes of the consumer. People would often trade with each other to obtain a complete set, hence the origin of their name.

            The first baseball cards were printed in the late 1860s by a sporting goods company when baseball became a professional sport. They were usually sold in packets of candy or tobacco products. Cigarette and candy companies started including baseball cards with their products to drive sales by capitalizing on the sport's popularity. Allen and Ginter in the U.S. in 1886 and British company W.D. & H.O. Wills in 1888 were the first tobacco companies to print advertisements. Companies of all kinds would insert these cards into product packaging as a prize.

            By 1900 there were thousands of tobacco card sets manufactured by 300 different companies. The T206 set distributed by the American Tobacco Company in 1909 is considered by collectors to be the most popular set of all time. In 1933 the Goudey Gum Company of Boston issued baseball cards with players' biographies on the backs and was the first to put baseball cards in bubble gum. The 1933 Goudey set remains one of the most popular and affordable vintage sets to this day. World War II put an end to cigarette card production due to limited paper resources and after the war, cigarette cards never really made a comeback. Collectors in the US subsequently moved to collecting bubble gum cards.
