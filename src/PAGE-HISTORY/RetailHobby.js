        <h2>Retail vs. Hobby Box Products</h2>
        <p>
            Hobby boxes are higher-end boxes of sports cards that often include more chase cards than retail boxes. Hobby boxes also tend to have higher price tags since they give you a better chance to pull sports cards that could be more valuable than those found in retail boxes. You'll also find special releases of hobby products, including 1st Off The Line products, Sapphire products, Jumbo products, Super Jumbo products, HTA products, Choice products, among others.

            A retail box is the type of sports card box you will find at most big-box stores such as Walmart and Target. Retail products can come in a variety of configurations, including Blaster Boxes, Mega Boxes, Value Boxes, Retail Boxes, Multi-Packs, Value Packs, Cello Packs, Rack Packs, Retail Packs, Factory Sets, Hanger Boxes, among others. Unlike hobby boxes that are designed to come with more chase cards in them, the chase cards in retail boxes will be few and far between. It's possible to open multiple packs from a retail box without finding a single chase card.

            Hobby boxes are targeted for the hardcore collector and generally focus on the premium aspects of a product like autographs and memorabilia cards. Odds of finding rare cards are typically higher. Most hobby products guarantee one signature or relic per box whereas retail blaster boxes do not carry such minimum guarantees. Plus, often hobby boxes are the only products that contain certain card varieties and parallels. Typically, high-end products are hobby-exclusive and will not be available in a retail format.
