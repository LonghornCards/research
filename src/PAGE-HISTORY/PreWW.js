        <h2>Pre-World War II Era</h2>
        <p>
            Baseball was the dominant sport in the U.S. for the bulk of the 20th century and baseball cards make up nearly all pre-WWII cards. These cards were less for collectors than they were tools of advertising. Prior to the early 1930s, there were not many cards made because complete sets were not produced every year. It is difficult to find cards from the early part of the century and even harder to find cards in good condition -- as a result, even poorly graded cards can be relatively valuable. In the early 1930s, a card production boom occurred with the famous 1933 Goudey set leading the way. (See Figures 10 & 11) There are still a relatively high number of cards in good condition nearly 100 years later from this time period.

            Sports cards originating as simple marketing inserts in tobacco products in the late 19th century have evolved into a dynamic aspect of sports culture -- from advertising tools to treasured collectibles. Initially, sports cards were not created with the intent of becoming collectibles. They were primarily marketing tools used by tobacco companies. The late 1800s was a period marked by a significant rise in the popularity of both smoking and professional sports. Tobacco companies saw an opportunity to capitalize on these trends by including cards in cigarette packs. These cards often referred to as "trade cards" served a dual purpose.

            First, they provided structural support to the cigarette packaging, helping to prevent the cigarettes from being crushed. Second, from a marketing perspective, they were used to advertise the tobacco company's brand. The inclusion of popular figures like actors, actresses, and athletes on these cards was a strategic decision. It was a way to appeal to a broad audience and create a connection between the consumer and the brand. Athletes quickly became some of the most popular due in part to the growing interest in professional sports during this era and advances in media communications.

            Baseball was prominent during this time-period in the US, and the depiction of baseball players on these cards resonated with the public. This popularity laid the groundwork for the eventual emergence of sports cards as a distinct category for mainstream collectors. Early sports cards were quite different from how they are today, however. They used to be more artistic in nature, featuring hand-drawn images and elaborate designs. The back of the cards typically contained advertisements for the tobacco product or other information about the company.

            The earliest known baseball card was produced in 1865, and it was a souvenir "visiting card" handed out to fans and opposing teams. Having won several city championships, the Brooklyn Atlantics dominated New York baseball in the early 1860s. That year, the Atlantics expanded their range and accepted a challenge from the Tri-Mountain Club held on Boston Common. Some three thousand spectators watched the visitors sprint away with a 107--16 victory.

            During 1909-1911, the American Tobacco Company produced the T206 set which is one of the most iconic and valuable in the history of sports cards. These cards were distributed in cigarette and tobacco packs as a promotional item. The set's long production run and the variety of brands under the American Tobacco Company's umbrella contributed to the large number of cards and variations within the set.

            The T206 set of 1909-1911 is renowned for their artistic quality. The cards feature vivid, colorful lithographs of players which are detailed and lifelike in their depictions. Each card has the player's name and team at the bottom, with a variety of back designs featuring advertisements for different tobacco brands. With over 500 cards, the T206 set is one of the most extensive pre-war sports cards sets.

            The set includes cards of some legendary figures in baseball history, like Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Cy Young, and Christy Mathewson. (See Figures 12-15) One of the most famous cards in the set, and indeed in the entire sports card collecting world, is the Honus Wagner card. Wagner, a Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop, was one of the era's greatest players. His card is extraordinarily rare, partly because Wagner objected to the use of his image, purportedly because he did not want to promote tobacco products to children. This led to a limited production of his card, making it one of the rarest and most valuable sports cards in existence. A Honus Wagner T206 card in good condition can fetch millions of dollars at auction.

            The T206 set is highly valued by collectors both for its historical significance and its rarity. The age, condition, and rarity of individual cards can lead to substantial prices. It's not just the famous players whose cards are valuable; even lesser-known players can command high prices due to the set's overall rarity and significance in the history of sports cards. The T206 set is a cornerstone of sports card collecting, representing a unique intersection of art, history, and sport. Its enduring legacy is a testament to the cultural impact of baseball in the early 20th century and the evolving nature of collectibles over time.

            The evolution of sports cards in the early 20th century marked a significant shift in their purpose and appeal, transforming them from simple promotional items into a more engaging and informative collectible. One of the most pivotal developments was the addition of player statistics and biographical information on the cards. This innovation was more than just a design change; it fundamentally altered how collectors interacted with the cards. By including stats like batting averages, home runs, and pitching records, along with personal information like birthplace, height, and weight, the cards became a source of information and learning. The inclusion of this data added an educational component to collecting.

            This period also saw a surge in the popularity of professional sports, particularly baseball. The growing media coverage of sports and the rise of iconic athletes helped fuel interest in sports cards. The addition of statistics and biographical information turned sports card collecting into a more dynamic hobby. Collectors began to seek specific cards based on a player's performance and career achievements. This also introduced the concept of card value being tied not just to rarity and condition, but also to a player's success and popularity.

            Alongside these informational additions, there were also changes in the design and aesthetics of the cards. The cards from this era often featured more sophisticated and varied designs compared to the earlier trade cards, reflecting advances in printing technology and design trends. While baseball cards were still predominant, this era also saw the expansion of sports cards to include other sports like football, boxing, and basketball, reflecting the growing popularity of these sports in American culture.

            The Pre-World War II era was a transformative period for sports cards, marked by a shift towards a younger audience, the inclusion of statistical and biographical information, and a broadening in the types of sports represented. These changes made sports cards more informative, engaging, and reflective of the growing cultural significance of professional sports in America.
