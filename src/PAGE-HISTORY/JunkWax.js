        <h2>Junk Wax Era</h2>

            The 1980s marked a significant era in the history of sports cards, characterized by a surge in popularity and the introduction of various innovations. Companies began experimenting with new technologies and materials to make cards more attractive and unique. This included the introduction of holographic cards, which had a shimmering, three-dimensional appearance, and foil-stamped cards, which featured metallic accents for a more premium look.

            This decade brought about key developments that not only transformed the sports card industry but also shaped the collecting community. The 1980s saw a boom in the number of card shops and the prevalence of sports card conventions. The 1980s was a decade of innovation in card design and production.

            This decade witnessed the entry of new companies into the sports card market, increasing competition and variety. Card companies, including Fleer, Donruss, Score, and Upper Deck, entered the space and met increased demand with overproduction. Brands like Upper Deck, which debuted in 1989, brought new ideas and quality standards to the industry, further invigorating the market. (See Figure 22)

            The 1980s saw a shift in the perception of sports cards from simple collectibles to potential investment pieces because the monetary worth of earlier cards began to increase. People began to regret the loss of their now-valuable childhood cards, so more people saved their collections in hopes of seeing an increase in value. Tremendous growth in the industry in the 1980s as cards from earlier years became valuable. The increasing value of rare and vintage cards, along with the popularity of rookie cards of emerging stars, led collectors to view sports cards as a form of financial investment.

            As sports card collecting experienced a surge in popularity, companies produced more cards to meet demand. Collectors in the 1980s knew how to keep cards in top condition this has resulted in few valuable cards from this era. In most cases, it's only the cards graded as a gem mint condition that fetch high prices because there were too many cards produced, and too many cards still exist in excellent condition. This overproduction of cards combined with an interest in protecting them led to most cards from the 1980s and 1990s being pretty much worthless today.

            The 1980s was a transformative decade for sports cards, characterized by a surge in popularity, community building through card shops and conventions, and significant innovations in card design and technology. These developments not only enhanced the appeal of card collecting but also laid the foundation for the modern sports card industry today.

            The 1990s carried the momentum from the 80s, and marked a pivotal era in the history of sports cards due to the unprecedented growth, technological advancements, and key trends that profoundly influenced the industry and collecting community over time decade. The 1990s witnessed significant advancements in card manufacturing technology - this led to the production of higher quality, more sophisticated cards featuring advanced printing techniques, better quality paper, and unique designs.

            Premium and limited-edition card series, with higher price points and superior quality, became popular among collectors. A major trend of the 1990s was the introduction of insert cards, or "chase cards," which were randomly included in card packs. These included autographed cards, memorabilia cards (containing pieces of player jerseys, bats, etc.), serial numbered cards, and holographic or foil cards.

            The 1990s saw the expansion of the sports card market beyond the traditional baseball, basketball, and football cards. The market saw the dominance of major brands like Topps, Upper Deck, and Fleer, (See Figures 24 & 25) alongside new entrants that further diversified the market. In 1995, Fleer acquired the trading card company SkyBox International. This competition led to constant innovation in card design and marketing strategies to capture the interest of collectors.

            The 1990s continued the trend of viewing sports cards as potential investments. This period also saw heightened interest in grading services, which assessed and certified the condition of cards, adding to their perceived investment value. The condition of the card is critical, and there are four areas of interest in determining a card's condition. Centering, corners, edges, and surface are taken into consideration, for imperfections, such as color spots and blurred images, and wear, such as creases, scratches, and tears, when determining a trading card's value. Trading cards have the most value when they are officially graded -- or ranked on their condition -- with 1 being "poor" and 10 being "gem mint." The most popular grading services are provided by Beckett and PSA.

            The 1990s experienced an increase in licensing agreements between card companies and sports leagues, as well as direct endorsements from athletes. This led to better representation of players and teams on cards and more official and authentic products. Autographs obtained by card manufacturers have become the most collected baseball cards in the hobby's history. This started in 1990 in baseball when Upper Deck randomly inserted autographs of Reggie Jackson into boxes. They are commonly referred to as "Certified Autographed Inserts" or "CAI's", and this has created the most authentic autographs in existence.

            In 1991 Topps ceased packaging gum with their baseball cards, making many collectors happy that their cards could no longer be damaged by gum stains. The following year, in 1992, Topps ceased using heavily waxed paper to wrap their packs of cards and began using cellophane plastic exclusively, thus eliminating the possibility of wax stains on the top and bottom cards in the packs.

            As the internet became more accessible in the late 90s, it began to influence the sports card industry. Online forums and marketplaces emerged, allowing collectors to connect, trade, and sell cards more easily on a global scale. Towards the end of the 1990s, the sports card market experienced a significant correction. The oversupply of cards, along with waning interest, led to a decline in both the value of cards and the number of active collectors. While the era introduced exciting innovations and expanded the sports card market, it also faced challenges that led to significant changes in the industry.
